# password_generator
An application that helps to generate randomized passwords.

# Technologies 
Javascript HTML CSS

# Purpose
The purpose in making this site was to better understand how to run Javascript and make a randomized password generator and to display my abilities in Javascript.

# Challenges
There were some challenges along the way. I found it difficult to figure out how to make the computer know the length in which the user chose for their password, and then to randomize it in that length, but after some trial and error I figured it out. It was also difficult for me to get the prompts to show at first and have select ones be confirm or prompt. Lastly I had trouble getting the website to display the password after answering the prompts. After trial and error I discovered how to code these things.

# What I learned
I learned a lot from the project about how to run Javascript. I have a better understanding of how to return values, call functions, write for loops, if/then statements; how to manipulate certain objects, numbers and arrays such as Math.random and Math.floor; and how to use operators such as ===.
